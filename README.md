Aim:
To develop a simple rule-based chatbot that identifies user queries and provides predefined responses using basic programming constructs like if-else statements or pattern matching techniques, simulating a natural conversational flow.

Objective:
Understand Chatbot Fundamentals: Learn the foundational principles behind chatbots, focusing on structured response mechanisms.
Develop Rule-Based Logic: Create a chatbot that applies predefined rules to process user queries and provide specific responses.
Enhance User Interaction: Design conversational pathways to ensure the chatbot can handle frequently asked questions or tasks effectively.
Explore Natural Language Processing (NLP): Introduce basic NLP concepts like keyword matching or phrase detection to understand query intent.
Simulate Conversation Flow: Build a logical flow to ensure that user interactions feel natural and consistent within the scope of predefined rules.

Description:
A rule-based chatbot is a conversational agent that relies on hard-coded rules to determine responses. Unlike advanced AI chatbots that learn and adapt using machine learning, rule-based chatbots use simple conditional logic or pattern recognition to provide fixed responses.

Components of the Chatbot:

Input Handling: Captures user input in the form of text or keywords.
Rule Matching: Uses predefined conditions (e.g., specific phrases, keywords) to match the query to a rule.
Response Generation: Responds with a predefined message associated with the matching rule.
Fallback Mechanism: Provides a default or "I donâ€™t understand" response when no rule matches.

Applications:

*Automating simple customer support tasks.
*Assisting users with predefined FAQs.
*Offering basic interaction in educational or informational systems.
